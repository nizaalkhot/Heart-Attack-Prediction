## About Dataset

### Dataset Description

This dataset focuses on "Heart Attack in Youth vs. Adults in Indonesia (Statewise)" and is designed for exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and public health research. The dataset contains simulated data of 170,501 individuals from various Indonesian states, providing a comprehensive view of the factors contributing to heart attack incidents among youth (15–40 years) and adults (41–65 years). The dataset aims to help understand demographic, lifestyle, environmental, and health-related trends.

### Context and Inspiration

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. By examining data from Indonesia—a diverse country with varying socio-economic, environmental, and healthcare access factors—we can uncover trends that can inform prevention strategies. The data reflects real-world unevenness and variability to simulate complex relationships, such as the interplay between age, lifestyle, environmental conditions, and medical history.
